# PINDOL
Phonon-Inspired Normal Dynamics of Lattices

**PINDOL** is a package to performs atom dynamics in the NVE and NVT ensembles. It exploits the Normal Dynamics formalism, allowing to perform Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics at the cost of Molecular Dynamics.

The **PINDOL** package contains the following codes:

- [**q4phind**](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/q4phind) (Preprocessing) Orders a q-point set as GM, H, S, used to generate qmatrix.nd and freq.nd with [QPOINTS](https://github.com/acammarat/phtools/tree/main/qpoints) compatible with [PHIND](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/phind)
- [**phind**](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/phind) (Preprocessing) Calculates the first order anharmonic interaction strength &Phi; to be used for the [PINDOL](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/pindol) code
- [**pindol**](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/pindol) Main code to perform Normal Dynamics simulations
- [**nd2xyz**](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/nd2xyz) (Postprocessing) Converts normal trajectories into XYZ format
- [**nd2hiphive**](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/nd2hiphive) (Postprocessing) Creates input files for [hiPhive](https://hiphive.materialsmodeling.org/) to extract the effective force constants

The preprocessing tool [QPOINTS](https://github.com/acammarat/phtools/tree/main/qpoints) must be used to prepare the qmatrix.nd and freq.nd files.

## Installation

The codes require a fortran compiler (tested with gfortran 11.3.0). After cloning, enter each folder and type

`make`

If the compilation ends successfully, the executable with the name of the code is created.

## How to prepare, run and analyse a Normal Dynamics simulation

The workflow on how to prepare, run and analyse a Normal Dynamics simulation can be found in the [*examples* folder](https://github.com/acammarat/pindol/tree/main/examples).

## Usage

For the usage of each code, please refer to the related README.md file.
