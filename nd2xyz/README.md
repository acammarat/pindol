# nd2xyz

Converts normal trajectories into XYZ format

## Installation

The code requires a fortran compiler. After cloning, enter the folder and compile it with

`make`

If the compilation ends successfully, the executable nd2xyz is created.

## Usage

The qmatrix.nd and freq.nd files of the reference geometry must be present in the folder where the code is executed.

The format of the input file is


```

string                  name of the POSCAR file
string                  name of the normal coordinate file
string                  name of the normal velocities file
string                  name of the normal accelerations file
int                     number of atomic types (natom_types)
string double           atomic symbol and mass (at_pertype(i), mass_pertype(i) [uma] of atom type 1
...  ...
string double           atomic symbol and mass (at_pertype(i), mass_pertype(i) [uma] of atom type natom_types
double double         time window: initial and final time
flag                  1 = write POSCAR restart from last configuration

```

where `int` is an integer number, `double` is a real number of type double, and `string` a string of type char. The command line syntax can be shown by using the `-h` option:

```

$ nd2xyz 
            _ ____

                         |___/     
                           0.7

  Syntax: nd2xyz <setting file>

```

After the execution .xyz files are created, as requested by the user.

## Example

The *nd2xyz.inp* file is an example of input file.
