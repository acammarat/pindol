! Phi for Normal Dynamics
! 
! Calculates the first order anharmonic interaction strength Phi(l,l',l'')
! to be used for the PINDOL code.
! The implemented selection rule is Delta(q+q'+q''); 
! the selection rules described in RSC Advances, 9, 37491 (2019)
! https://doi.org/10.1039/C9RA08294H
! are not implemented.
! Phi(l,l',l'') is not written for any triplet involving at least 
! one of the skip modes as specified in the header of freq.nd
